## Lesson 0: Preparation for the tutorial
##### [Back to Home](../index.md)

### Overview


#### 1) Download Zoom

We will be screensharing over Zoom for remote participants so please [install it](https://zoom.us/download) on your computer if you haven't already. You may also join the Zoom if you are participating in person, however in this case please remain completely _off audio_ (note that this is different from just being on mute). 

Let's face it: an all-day video conference is hard. It will be more fun if it is as lively and interactive as possible, so please participate by video unless you have bandwidth constraints.

#### 2) Make sure you have a computer to use

You will need to bring a laptop (if in person) or a computer to work on (if remote)

#### 3) Join the MTIP team and chatroom

- You will first need a GitHub account if you don't already have one; it is absolutely free at github.com/join. 
- Then join the public tutorial Chat room on Gitter here and sign in with GitHub
- I will then invite each to the MTIP tutorial team on GitHub. Membership in the team will give you the credentials you will need to complete the exercises.

#### 4) Bring your tired, huddled documents yearning to be free

Please be partially overlapping, potentially conflicting and for which you would like to consolidate into a single source of truth for your team. One way of doing this is to search for a word or phrase that should not have as many hits as it does. Could be multiple versions of a document. Could be different slices of documents for different audiences.
