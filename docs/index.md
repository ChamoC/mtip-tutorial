Translational Informatics projects are increasingly cross-institutional and even international; managing them comes with lots of shared pain points. This one day workshop will provide hands-on training to anyone who is organizing or managing cross-functional distributed teams that develop code or that analyze data across the translational divide*. Specifically, we will introduce several the practical tools and techniques for managers to facilitate these kinds of endeavors. The hands-on training will familiarize participants with helpful tools and techniques, and to help them make informed decisions about which tools might work best for their particular contexts. We conclude with a session wherein all participants are welcome to share additional pain points and related experience.

**Who should attend**: Informatics program, and project managers, as well as PIs that may function in this role  
**Prerequisites**: No prior knowledge of any of the tools is required, and participation in any or all of the modules is warmly welcome.  
**Cost**: Free to attend
